# Half and Quarter Size Sheets

This repository contains the source code to an app that shows how to use .overlay() modifier to create half-screen and quarter-screen size sheets when .sheet is just too large for your needs.

You can read more on my blog at: https://www.keaura.com/blog/sheets-with-swiftui

Download or clone this repository. It is a runable app (without icons or anything). I cover or reference the following topics:

- overlay modifier
- View extension functions
- ViewModifier
- GeometryReader
- @ViewBuilder

Enjoy!
